Hi, I’m Aisha 👋  

🎓 I’m currently studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence BSc.  
📊 I’m especially interested in machine learning, data-driven decision making, and how AI can solve real-world problems.  
💻 I’m building my skills in Python, statistics, and analytical thinking.  
🧠 I’m fascinated by Ted Talks, optimisation, and understanding patterns — whether in data, systems, or human behaviour.  
🌍 I enjoy connecting technical knowledge with real-world applications.  
🤝 I’m open to collaborating on beginner-to-intermediate AI, data analysis, or research projects.  
📚 Ask me about: data fundamentals, anything conspiracy related, my current favourite book, or anything self-improvement related

⚡ Fun fact: I love using my creativity to analysing and display patterns — from datasets to urban case studies to why cookies spread in the oven.
🎀 Favourite colour: Forever will be pink 🌸
