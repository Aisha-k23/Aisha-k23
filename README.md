Hi, I’m Aisha 👋  

🎓 I’m currently studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence BSc.  
📊 I’m especially interested in machine learning, data-driven decision making, and how AI can solve real-world problems.  
💻 I’m building my skills in Python, statistics, and analytical thinking.  
🧠 I’m fascinated by psychology, optimisation, and understanding patterns — whether in data, systems, or human behaviour.  
🌍 I enjoy connecting technical knowledge with real-world applications.  
🤝 I’m open to collaborating on beginner-to-intermediate AI, data analysis, or research projects.  
📚 Ask me about: data fundamentals, GCSE geography (still a favourite), baking experiments, or self-improvement systems.  
📫 How to reach me: Aishakakazi@gmail.com
😄 Pronouns: she/her  
⚡ Fun fact: I love analysing patterns — from datasets to urban case studies to why cookies spread in the oven.
